# Images containing Python applications

Users are typically migrating from [py3_image](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker#py3_image)
in rules_docker.
(There is also an older `py_image` rule that's meant for Python 2, which is end-of-life and not considered here).

TODO: document how to get the third-party pypi dependencies into a separate layer beneath the
application.

## Example

An example is needed! Please consider contributing one. :pray:
